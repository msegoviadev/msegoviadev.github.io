# Hey, I'm Marcos! 👋

I'm a software engineer who builds software for a living and somehow still enjoys it. Living in Switzerland but bound to Spain, writing code that (hopefully) has some meaning in life.

## What I Do

I build web applications and backend systems, mostly focusing on:
- Backend engineering, plus frontend that's good enough (thank you, AI)
- Scalable backend architectures
- Developer tools and automation
- Using AI for everything I can get away with

## The Honest Bits

- I believe good code should be readable by humans first, computers second
- Simplicity beats complexity every single time
- Coffee is essential (seriously)
- Still learning something new every day (the tech world moves fast)
- Not replaced by AI yet

## This Site

Here, I share my projects, technical insights, and lessons learned. You'll find honest stories of what worked and what didn't.
